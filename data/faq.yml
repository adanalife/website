questions: 

  - q: Did your van have solar panels?

      <p>
      Unfortunately not!
      While I looked into adding them, the price was high and my power needs were low.
      Next time I do a trip like this I will probably want solar, mainly because it means I could go much longer stretches without driving.

  - q: What did you do for electricity?
    a: >-
      <p>
      My van had two batteries, a standard starter battery for the engine, and a deep-cell "coach" battery for the living quarters.
      The coach battery powered the interior lights, a rear cigarette-lighter-style power outlet, and the rooftop fan.
      Both batteries were charged whenever the engine was running and when I was plugged into "shore power."
      A small compartment on the exterior of the van contained a typical three-pronged power cord which I extended with a heavy-duty 100' extension cord.

      While there were many outlets available in the interior cabin, none of them worked unless I was on shore power.
      One small addition made everything a lot easier though... hidden in a cupboard was an inverter with two power outlets.
      This let me run two devices off of the coach battery, which is how I powered my laptop to write this blog!

  - q: How did you keep food cold?
    a: >-
      <p>
      The fridge built in to the van could be powered in three ways: shore power, the coach battery, and propane.
      With propane I could keep it cold when I was holding still for several days, but I rarely used this feature.
      Instead, I found a fancy <a href="https://www.engelcoolers.com/mr040f-u1-mr040f-u1-ac-dc-fridge-freezer.html">marine fridge</a> on sale and used that for everything.
      This way I could keep things cold with only battery power, and boy could that thing get cold!

      I <a href="/2018/02/14/and-we-re-off/">started in San Francisco</a> in mid-February.
      I made my way down the California coast, stopping by <a href="/2018/02/21/trip-report-big-sur/">Big Sur</a>, <a href="/2018/03/05/trip-report-central-coast/">the central coast cities</a>, and <a href="/2018/03/13/trip-report-los-angeles/">LA</a>, before stopping in <a href="/2018/03/20/trip-report-san-diego/">San Diego</a>.
      I then went to <a href=""></a> before coming <a href=""><em>back</em></a> to SF.
      Next was <a href="/2018/04/06/trip-report-yosemite/">Yosemite</a>, after which I headed for the desert.

      <p>
      After visiting a series of parks in the Southwest, I stopped by Santa Fe before heading to my dad's house in Dallas.
      I rested there for a bit before heading to Austin, TX for a music festival.
      From there I went deeper south to Big Bend, which was one of my very favorite stops on the trip.
      Next I headed north, stopping by national parks on my way to Salt Lake City.
      It was there that I somewhat-randomly got backstage passes to see <a href="/2018/05/09/photos-that-time-i-saw-pink/">P!NK</a> in concert.
