questions: 
  - q: What did you do for electricity?

      My van had two batteries, a standard starter battery for the engine, and a deep-cell "coach" battery for the living quarters.
      The coach battery powered the interior lights, a rear cigarette-lighter-style power outlet, and the rooftop fan.
      Both batteries were charged whenever the engine was running and when I was plugged into "shore power."
      A small compartment on the exterior of the van contained a typical three-pronged power cord which I extended with a heavy-duty 100' extension cord.

      The fridge could be powered in three ways: shore power, the coach battery, and propane.
      With propane I could keep it cold when I was holding still for several days.

      While there were many outlets available in the interior cabin, none of them worked unless I was on shore power.
      One small addition made everything a lot easier though... hidden in a cupboard was an inverter with two power outlets.
      This let me run two devices off of the coach battery, which is how I powered my laptop to write this blog!

  - q: Did your van have solar panels?

      Unfortunately not!
      While I looked into adding them, the price was high and my power needs were low.
      Next time I do a trip like this I will probably want solar, mainly because it means I could go much longer stretches without driving.
