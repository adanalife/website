questions:

  - q: What kind of van was it?
    a: >-
      <p>
      It was a <strong><a href="/van-tour">92D190V</a></strong>.
      That's how other Roadtrek owners refer to a 1992 Dodge Roadtrek 190 Versatile.
      The 190 means it's 19ft (5.8m) from bumper to bumper.
      Versatile refers to the van's footprint: four total seat-buckled seats, as opposed to the Roadtrek Popular which only has three.

  - q: How did you poop?
    a: >-
      <p>
      While I was lucky enough to have a van with a built-in toilet, I never used it for "#2".
      Finding a reliable clean bathroom was a daily challenge, but I started to pick up tricks (and lower my standards).
      Walmarts, libraries, coffee shops, campgrounds, rest stops, friends houses and the gym were common options.

  - q: How did you shower?
    a: >-
      <p>
      One of the early challenges of the trip was transitioning from being a daily-showerer to someone who showered only about once a week.
      Wet wipe "baths" were a common technique.
      Some vans have built-in showers but mine did not, so instead I got a membership to a national gym chain.
      This way I had a reliable place to shower, and a good excuse to stay in shape.

      I <a href="/2018/02/14/and-we-re-off/">started in San Francisco</a> in mid-February.
      I made my way down the California coast, stopping by <a href="/2018/02/21/trip-report-big-sur/">Big Sur</a>, <a href="/2018/03/05/trip-report-central-coast/">the central coast cities</a>, and <a href="/2018/03/13/trip-report-los-angeles/">LA</a>, before stopping in <a href="/2018/03/20/trip-report-san-diego/">San Diego</a>.
      I then went to <a href=""></a> before coming <a href="/2018/04/01/a-trip-back-to-san-francisco/"><em>back</em></a> to SF.
      Next was <a href="/2018/04/06/trip-report-yosemite/">Yosemite</a>, after which I headed for the desert.

      After visiting a series of parks in the Southwest, I stopped by Santa Fe before heading to my dad's house in Dallas.
      I rested there for a bit before heading to Austin, TX for a music festival.
      From there I went deeper south to Big Bend, which was one of my very favorite stops on the trip.
      Next I headed north, stopping by national parks on my way to Salt Lake City.
      It was there that I somewhat-randomly got backstage passes to see <a href="/2018/05/09/photos-that-time-i-saw-pink/">P!NK</a> in concert.
      </p>
      <p>
      After SLC I went to the Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks, another highlight of the trip.
      From there I made a beeline eastward toward Chicago, stopping by the Badlands, Devil's Tower, and Mt. Rushmore on the way.
      I spent a long time in Chicago before heading to Detroit to visit the Henry Ford museum, after which I went to Niagra Falls.
      From there I went to Letchworth State Park in Upstate NY, and then Hartford, CT.
      I spent the whole summer in New England, including an entire month on Martha's Vineyard, a week at Acadia, and a week at a Buddhist monastery.
      </p>
      <p>
      As summer drew to a close I headed south, stopping by various Civil War battlefields that were of interest to me.
      On my way to the Great Smokey Mountains I had my (mechanical) <a href="/2018/09/24/disaster/">breakdown</a>.
      I went back to Dallas to get everything fixed up, and then drove straight across the country to LA to meet a friend at a music festival.
      From there I made my way back up the California coast, spending more time in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara.
      Finally, I ended up back in SF where I lived on the streets for 6 weeks while I worked on selling the van.

  - q: Did your van have solar panels?
    a: >-
      <p>
      Unfortunately not!
      While I looked into adding them, the price was high and my power needs were low.
      Next time I do a trip like this I will probably want solar, mainly because it means I could go much longer stretches without driving.

  - q: What did you do for electricity?
    a: >-
      <p>
      My van had two batteries, a standard starter battery for the engine, and a deep-cell "coach" battery for the living quarters.
      The coach battery powered the interior lights, a rear cigarette-lighter-style power outlet, and the rooftop fan.
      Both batteries were charged whenever the engine was running and when I was plugged into "shore power."
      A small compartment on the exterior of the van contained a typical three-pronged power cord which I extended with a heavy-duty 100' extension cord.
      </p>
      <p>
      While there were many outlets available in the interior cabin, none of them worked unless I was on shore power.
      One small addition made everything a lot easier though... hidden in a cupboard was an inverter with two power outlets.
      This let me run two devices off of the coach battery, which is how I powered my laptop to write this blog!

  - q: How did you keep food cold?
    a: >-
      <p>
      The fridge built in my Roadtrek could be powered in three ways: shore power, the coach battery, and propane.
      With propane I could keep it cold when I was holding still for several days, but I rarely used this feature.
      Instead, I found a fancy <a href="https://www.engelcoolers.com/mr040f-u1-mr040f-u1-ac-dc-fridge-freezer.html">marine fridge</a> on sale and used that for everything.
      This way I could keep things cold with only battery power, and boy could that thing get cold!

  - q: Did you get lonely?
    a: >-
      <p>
      Sure, at times.
      I had abandoned a life surrounded by friends and coworkers to venture by myself into the unknown.
      The first couple weeks were the toughest, as I was still figuring out the lifestyle, and I had no one in my circles to turn to for advice.
      The excitement outweighed the feelings of isolation, however, and I quickly settled into new degree of comfort with myself.
      Later in the trip, waves of loneliness would hit me after spending a few weeks without seeing anyone I knew.
      Luckily I have friends and family scattered across the country -- most of whom were happy to have me visit -- so anytime I felt I needed company all I had to do was point the van in their direction.
