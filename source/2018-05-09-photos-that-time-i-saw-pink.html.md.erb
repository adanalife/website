While staying with family in Salt Lake City, I was lucky enough to be invited to see the artist [P!NK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_(singer)) perform.
If that wasn't enough, I was given a backstage pass, which let me watch the show from the front row.

I don't know her music that well but I had a blast, caught a stick from her drummer, and had a once-in-a-lifetime experience!

Here's the backstage pass and the stick that I caught.

Her flying rig was elaborate and jaw-dropping.

Eminem wasn't there to perform, but they did have a gigantic inflatable version of him.
