After my wonderful stay in [Joshua Tree](/2018/03/25/trip-report-joshua-tree) I pointed my van back North.
At this point I had traveled from San Francisco all the way down the California coast, but I already wanted to go back.
I drove through LA and spent another night at my favorite spot in Venice.

Why go back to San Francisco?
It's not that I was ready to end the trip; this was actually part of the plan all along.

Before I embarked on this journey, when I was creating a rough outline of my trip, I had factored in return largely to give myself an opportunity to visit my storage locker.
The idea was: if I needed anything I already owned, I could pick it up; if I had brought anything with me it turns out I didn't need, I could drop it off.

I had been on the road for six weeks at this point and had a pretty good idea about what vanlife was like.
It turns out, I didn't really need to visit the storage locker.
After only two weeks on the road (while [staying in Santa Barbara](/2018/03/05/trip-report-central-coast/)) I was able to offload a box of unnecessary stuff to the safekeeping of my aunt.
The stuff I didn't need was mainly duplicate items... I didn't need _three_ towels, two was probably fine.
I also left a large amount of toiletries, which in my haste to pack I had just decided to bring almost everything.

So instead of visiting my storage locker, I went back to visit my friends.
As a former resident, my parking permit was valid, so I returned to my neighborhood 
<%= mn(linked_image("#{current_article.url}van-on-panhandle.jpg", 'my Roadtrek parked on the Panhandle in San Francisco')) %>
and lived on the street for a week.
I stopped by my old work and surprised everyone ("are you done already?"), and I hit up some of my favorite restaurants.

Several of my friends -- who all happened to be funemployed at the same time -- and I arranged to go for a hike on a quiet sunny weekday afternoon.
We drove out to Point Reyes (perhaps my very favorite place to see nature in the Bay Area) and took a long hike out to a beach and back.
It was a real treat to savor a nice day with a bunch of people who were all "supposed to" be at work.

I could feel myself getting back into my old habits though, so I capped my stay at one week.
On the last day, I drove out to the Golden Gate Bridge to get the iconic "I used to live in SF and now I live in a van" picture... I think it turned out great!

Thanks for reading.
Next stop, Yosemite!
