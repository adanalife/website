For the past year I've been running [a slow-tv art project](TODO).
It's comprised of an immense trove of my own dashcam footage and a custom chatbot to interact with the footage.
I'm writing this to announce that I've made the [source code to Tripbot](https://github.com/dmerrick/tripbot) publicly available.


### What can the bot do?

Here are some of the things you can ask of Tripbot:

 * **`!location`** will tell you all about where we are driving, including a Google Maps link
 * **`!date`** tells you the day the footage was recorded
 * **`!miles`** are a way to earn points for watching the stream... **`!leaderboard`** shows the users who have the most miles.
 * **`!guess`** gives viewers an opportunity to guess what state we're in, e.g. `!guess CA` guesses that we're in California

Future commands include `!map` (to display a map on the stream) and `!temperature` (to get information about the weather at the current moment).



### General architecture

<%= f "#{current_article.url}infra-diagram.png", 'TODO' %>

The project is comprised of two main components: a bot process and a VLC process.
They are both written in Golang, and they talk to one another over HTTP.
The bot might ask the VLC process _what video is currently playing?_ or it might say _play this specific video_.

Running alongside VLC is Open Broadcaster Software, or [OBS](https://obsproject.com/).
It's an open-source, cross-platform streaming tool that has been a joy to use.

Also present (though not included in the diagram above) is a music server using [MPD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Player_Daemon).
You can think of it like a headless iTunes, through which the bot can control the currently-playing audio.
