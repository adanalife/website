After a nice visit to Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, my _check engine_ light went on.
I'd been on the road for over seven months at this point, and I hadn't yet had any major issues with the van.

There was no ususual noise or behavior when the light turned on, so I continued on my way to Appomattox, Virginia, where I intended to see the courthouse where the Civil War came to an end.
I drove onward through remote country roads as the evening sky faded from blue to orange.


## Day One

My radio clicked off abruptly, and it continued to restart itself over and over.
Annoyed, I pulled over to a safe place and tried turning the car off and on again.
To my supreme disappointment the van wouldn't start.
I tried turning the key in the ignition a few times.
Perhaps there was something wrong with the battery?

I didn't have to wait long before a friendly Southern lady offered me a jump, and since I was only about 20 minutes away from the Walmart I was calling home that night, I got back on the road.
This is when things really started to go wrong.

Cruising down the backroads of Virginia and my headlights start to dim.  
The radio clicks off again.  
The engine clunks -- a misfire!  
I start to lose speed.  
I turn on the hazard lights -- nothing happens.  

A frustrated driver behind me passes me as I search for a safe place to pull over.
I turn into a dark rural road and come to a stop outside of a sketchy-looking house.
No cell phone service here.

After some time I work up the courage to go knock on the door of the house.
I introduce myself to the confused couple that answers and explain my situation, and while talking to them I manage to get some cell service, so I tell them that I probably don't need them but that I might be there for a while while I get myself towed.

While on the phone with AAA a police cruiser pulls up... apparently the house called the cops on me!
I explained the situation to the deputy and after running my plates he wished me luck and drove off.
It was dark now and it would be three more hours before the tow truck arrived.

Next I get towed to a small mechanics shop in Appomattox.
It's nearly 2AM now.
The tow truck driver leaves and I settle in to the not-quite-ideal location for the night.
I'm optimistic that I'll be back on the road again tomorrow.

## Day Two

I get up 15 minutes before the mechanic opens and leave them a voicemail.
They call me back promptly and they agree to fit me in right away.
Great!
Honestly so far this is going pretty well.

They think the problem is with my alternator.
Alternators are responsible for taking converting the motion of the engine into electicity, which it then uses to charge the battery.
This is why your car's battery lasts so long, and a faulty alternator is the most likely cause of a battery that dies while driving.
This makes sense to me and they go to work.

Unfortunately, after they finish installing the new alternator, the battery still isn't charging correctly.
The mechanics tell me they don't know why, and they can't help me any more.

Well, crap.

Let's take stock of my situation here.
I'm in the middle of nowhere and very far from anywhere I call home (MA and TX).
Even though I've just paid a couple hundred dollars on a repair, my van is still broken and immobile.
It's 85 degrees fahrenheit, I'm parked in direct sun, and battery that powers my fan is dead.

I set to work calling other local mechanics.
Without going into unnecessary detail, no one I talked to was willing to take on an electrical issue like this, and the places that would take me weren't free until Monday, or until October.
It was a Friday in mid-September.

I needed a new plan, or I'd be stuck living in this mechanic's parking lot with no power and nowhere to go.

I decided to get another tow, this time two-and-a-half hours away, from Nowhere, Virginia to Somewhere, North Carolina.
There I could find a plethora of mechanics.
My reluctant tow truck driver picked up my van and we set off.
