After a nice visit to Thomas Jefferson's [Monticello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monticello), my **check engine** light went on.
There was no unusual noise or behavior when the light turned on, so I continued on my way to Appomattox, Virginia.

I had intended to see the courthouse where the Civil War came to an end.
I drove onward through remote country roads as the evening sky faded from blue to orange.
I'd been on the road for over seven months at this point, and I hadn't yet had any major issues with the van.


## Day One

My radio clicked off abruptly, slowly booted back up, and clicked off again.
Frustrated by the sudden silence, I pulled over to a safe place and tried turning the car off and on again.
I tried turning the key in the ignition a few times.
To my supreme disappointment the engine wouldn't turn.
_Perhaps there was something wrong with the battery?_

I didn't have to wait long before a friendly Southern lady offered me a jump, and since I was only about 20 minutes away from the Walmart that would serve as my home for the night, I got back on the road.
This is when things really started to go wrong.

Cruising down the backroads of Virginia and my headlights start to dim.  
The radio clicks off again.  
The engine clunks -- a misfire!  
I begin to lose speed.  
I turn on the hazard lights -- nothing happens.  

An angry driver behind me passes me as I search for a safe place to pull over.
I turn down a dark rural road and come to a stop outside of a sketchy-looking house.
There is no cell phone service here.

After some time I work up the courage to go knock on the door of the house.
I introduce myself to the confused couple that answers the door, and while explaining my situation I manage to get some cell service, so I tell them that I probably don't need them, but that I might be there for a while while I get myself towed.

While on the phone with AAA a police cruiser pulls up... apparently the house called the cops on me!
I explained the situation to the deputy and, after running my plates, he wished me luck and drove off.
It was dark now and it would be three more hours before the tow truck arrived.

I get towed the 20 minutes to a small mechanics shop tucked against some train tracks in Appomattox.
It's nearly 2AM now.
The tow truck driver leaves and I settle in to the not-quite-ideal location for the night.
I'm optimistic that I'll be back on the road again tomorrow.

## Day Two

I get up 15 minutes before the mechanic opens and leave them a voicemail.
They call me back promptly and they agree to fit me in right away.
Great!
Honestly so far this is going pretty well.

They think the problem is with my [alternator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternator).
Alternators are responsible for taking converting the motion of the engine into electricity, which it then uses to charge the battery.
This is why your car's battery lasts so long, and a faulty alternator is the most likely cause of a battery that dies while driving.
This makes sense to me and they go to work.

Unfortunately, after they finish installing the new alternator, the battery still isn't charging correctly.
The mechanics tell me they don't know why, and they can't help me any more.

Well, crap.

Let's take stock of my situation here.
I'm in the middle of nowhere and very far from anywhere I call home (MA and TX).
Even though I've just paid a couple hundred dollars on a repair, my van is still broken and immobile.
It's 85 degrees Fahrenheit, I'm parked in direct sun, and battery that powers my fan is dead.

I set to work calling other local mechanics.
Without going into unnecessary detail, no one I talked to was willing to take on an electrical issue like this, and the places that would take me weren't free until Monday, or until October.
It was a Friday in mid-September.

I needed a new plan, or I'd be stuck living in this mechanic's parking lot with no power and nowhere to go.

I decided to get another tow, this time two-and-a-half hours away, from Nowhere, Virginia to Somewhere, North Carolina.
There I could find a plethora of mechanics.
My reluctant tow truck driver picked up my van and we set off.

## Day Three

Finally I found someone who was open on Saturday and was willing to take on my electrical issues.
<%= mn("Shoutout to AAA Wendover!") %>
I was given no promises on when/if they would fix it.
I grabbed my laptop and an empty desk in their office and settled myself in.

Six hours later they had figured out what was wrong.
The [battery isolator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_isolator), which takes power from the alternator and passes it to my van's two batteries, was burnt out.
And I mean really burnt.

Well, okay!
There's the problem!
It was immensely satisfying to be able to hold this in my hand and know that the mysterious issue was now an obvious problem.

Another three hours later, just after closing, they were done replacing the isolator.
The engine started up fine and charged the battery fine.
After 48 hours of being immobile, I was finally free.

## Conclusion

Living in a van is wonderful, that is, until something goes wrong.
Being able to choose your backyard every day is exciting and freeing and glamorous, but when you have an issue that renders the vehicle inoperable, the van becomes a prison.
At that point the van is just a metal box on the side of the road.
It's not a good feeling.

The thing that made this particular experience so difficult was how far away I was from my friends or family.
My home bases are in California, Texas, and Massachusetts, all of which are very far away from Virginia.
I had to figure this out, and I had to figure it out by myself.

At the worst moments -- when I'd paid for a new alternator and I was still stranded, when sweat was dripping down my body and every mechanic was telling me they couldn't help me -- I saw that I had a choice.
I could get angry, or cry, or yell at somebody, but none of these things would change my situation.
Instead I tried my best to remain calm, to keep looking for new solutions, and to keep my emotions in check.

By remaining calm and patient, I was eventually able to get out of the situation and make it to my campsite at the Great Smoky Mountains on time.
Another adventure behind me, and many new ones on the road in front of me.
