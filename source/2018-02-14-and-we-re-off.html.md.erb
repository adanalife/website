Yesterday was my last day as a resident of San Francisco.
It was a busy day, I still had to pack some stuff, move some furniture onto the street, clean up the apartment, and load up the van.
It's absurd how many things needed to be done to prep for this journey, it's like moving to two different places (the van and the storage container) while also packing for two vacations (camping and a road trip).
I am a person who enjoys logistics but after four consecurtive days of this I'm exhausted.

My friend Cam came over early and helped me by breaking down boxes and keeping me company while sitting in the only available chair.
I counted all of the lasts: the last time sleeping in my bed, the last shower, the last walk around the neighborhood, the last time time I closed the door.
