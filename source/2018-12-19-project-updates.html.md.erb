Ten months ago I reversed my campervan out of my driveway in San Francisco and set forth on a magnificent adventure.
I had ended my lease, put my possessions in storage, and packed the van with things I might need.
I travelled alone across the country and back, from San Diego to Maine.
I experienced so many great things, and I am so excited to share it all with you!

For those who have been following this blog since I started, you know that my articles are few and far between.
Each article takes me hours of editing (even more if I have lots of photos), and vanlife isn't usually condusive to sitting in front of a computer long stretches.
I have been slowly, sneakily backfilling articles so that they look like I wrote them in realtime.
The plan is to eventually have an article about every awesome place I went, so new visitors can read through the whole story.
