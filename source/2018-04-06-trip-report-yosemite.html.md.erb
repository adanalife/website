After swinging through [San Francisco](/2018/04/01/a-trip-back-to-san-francisco) to check in with my friends and visit my storage locker, I got back on the road.
My next stop was one of my very favorite places on the planet, [Yosemite National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosemite_National_Park).

If you've never been to Yosemite it can be tricky to understand why people love it so much.
To paint a picture of the experience, imagine standing next to a massive wall of stone.
You can walk right up to the wall and put your hand on it.
Above you it towers taller than any building you have ever seen -- over 270 stories.
Behind you is a wall of similar scale, and pouring off these walls in every direction are waterfalls.
It makes you feel really small, and you immediately know it's a special place.

I spent three nights camping at the _Upper Pines Campground_.
It's a popular campground and it was full, even in April.
I reserved three different campsites (_#9_, _#27_, and _#144_) and had to change over every morning.
Luckily since I was in the van, moving camp was easy!
The sites themselves were fine, but it was crowded and noisy and it lacked privacy.
If you're coming to Yosemite to get away from people, you might want to consider backcountry camping instead of one of the busy campgrounds.

Since the campground is right in Yosemite Valley, I spent the first day walking around the valley floor.
I took photos of some of the waterfalls and the broad side of the famous Half Dome.

It's a spiritual place, and I was contented sitting by the river and watching time pass.


<%= quote "Everything is flowing -- going somewhere, animals and so-called lifeless rocks as well as water. Thus the snow flows fast or slow in grand beauty-making glaciers and avalanches; the air in majestic floods carrying minerals, plant leaves, seeds, spores, with streams of music and fragrance; water streams carrying rocks... While the stars go streaming through space pulsed on and on forever like blood...in Nature's warm heart.", "John Muir" %>


The next morning I climbed to the top of Upper Falls.
It's quite a hike, alternating between switchbacks and stairs for the entire 5-mile length.
You get to get up close to two different waterfalls (Upper and Lower Falls) and the view from the top is extraordinary.
If I were to do it again, I would start earlier in the morning, because it got very crowded.
