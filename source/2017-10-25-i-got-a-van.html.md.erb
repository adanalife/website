I got a van yesterday.
It's a *1992 Dodge Roadtrek 190 Versatile*.

<%= marginnote(
  tag(:img, src: "#{current_article.url}layout.png", alt: 'the layout of a Roadtrek 190 Versatile') + "The internal layout. The front seats spin around, and the rear dinette converts to a queen-sized bed."
) %>
<%= figure "#{current_article.url}the-van.png", 'My van' %>

Out of all of the vans in the Bay Area, why did I pick this one?
Well, a ton of thought went into the decision, but I can provide a summary. 

Originally I wanted a [Westfalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Westfalia_Camper), because I find their boxy aesthetic adorable.
I rented one for two weeks, but decided that I wanted something newer, something more reliable.
Plus, Westies are more expensive than simiar vans because of how trendy and cute they are.

At the end of the rental, I made a list of things my dream van would have.
It looked something like this:

* high top instead of a pop top
* bigger sink
* hot and cold water
* 4WD if possible
* inconspicuous
* cruise control
* reliable heating / AC
* plenty of lighting
* plenty of storage
* separate power system for leisure

I scoured Craigslist posts for months looking for vans that met as many of these as possible.
I'm happy to say that this Roadtrek meets almost all of them, and more!<%= mn "The only criteria I couldn't meet? It's not a 4WD van, but all of those were way out of my price range." %>
I can stand in it, it has a full kitchen, it has a toilet if I want it, and so much more.
I'm beyond excited, and I can't wait to share more adventures with you!
