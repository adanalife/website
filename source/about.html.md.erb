## About Me

<%# by setting the icon to an empty string, no "+" icon will appear above the heading %>
<%= marginnote(image_tag('/about/dana.jpg', alt: 'a photo of Dana', title: "That's me!"), icon: '') %>
Hey, my name is Dana and I am a 30-something human living in the United States.

In February 2018 I quit my job in San Francisco and <%= link_to 'moved into a campervan', '/tags/van' %> full-time. I intend to travel the US for about a year, and have been sharing photos and stories from my travels here on this site.

To find me on social media, please visit the <%= link_to('contact page', '/contact') %>.

If you're looking to hire me, <%= link_to('my resume is available on Github', 'https://github.com/dmerrick/resume') %>.

If you're looking for more info on how I built this site, the source code is available on Github <%= link_to('here', 'https://github.com/adanalife/website') %>, and I have written two blog articles explaining my process: <%= link_to('part 1', '/2017/10/01/how-this-site-works/') %> and <%= link_to('part 2', '/2017/10/12/how-this-site-works-p-2/') %>.
