## About Me

Hey, my name is Dana and I am a 30-something human living in the United States.

For a complete list of public social media accounts, visit my <%= link_to('Keybase account', 'https://keybase.io/dmerrick') %>. That list is kept up-to-date and is cryptographically secure. You can also use it to send me messages (or just use the <%= link_to('contact page', '/contact') %> if you're feeling old school).

If you're looking to hire me, my resume is available on Github <%= link_to('here', 'https://github.com/dmerrick/resume') %>.

If you're looking for how this site works, the source code is available on Github <%= link_to('here', 'https://github.com/dmerrick/danalol') %>, and I have written two blog articles explaining my process: <%= link_to('part 1', '/2017/10/01/how-this-site-works/') %> and <%= link_to('part 2', '/2017/10/12/how-this-site-works-p-2/') %>.
