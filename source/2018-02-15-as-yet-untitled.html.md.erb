The first week is behind me, and I have returned to the land of reliable Internet and power.
I have so much to share with you, so I've broken it down into sections so you can skip to the things that interest you the most.

* Overview
* Places Gone
* Mental/Physical Condition
* Meals
* Leisure Time
* Unique Experiences
