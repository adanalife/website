I'm excited to announce that I've made the [source code to Tripbot](https://github.com/dmerrick/tripbot), the bot that powers [the most boring stream on Twitch](TODO), publicly available.
Let's dive in to what this bot can do and how it works.


### General architecture

### Old article

With the most boring footage on the cutting room floor, I was ready to go live.
But I was missing something.
Pleasant footage and pleasant music might be enough to pass the bare minimum requirements to be a Twitch channel, but there was nothing to keep a viewer engaged, nothing to keep them coming back.
Furthermore, with a 24/7 stream there was no way I could be around to chat and answer peoples' questions.

So I built a robot.

But first, some background:
Twitch chat is an always-running chatroom associated with every channel on Twitch.
Viewers of a channel can interact with other viewers and the streamer, and streamers occasionally utilize off-the-shelf software called "chatbots" to simplify common tasks.
<!-- For instance a viewer might run `!uptime` to see how long a stream has been running, or  -->

None of the existing bots could do what I wanted my bot to do, so I built my own, from scratch.
I named him Tripbot.
Most new visitors to my channel come and go without even noticing there is a helpful bot in the channel, but I can say with certainty that more hours have been put into building the bot than any other feature of the channel.

Here are some of the things you can ask of Tripbot:

 * **`!location`** will tell you all about where we are driving, including a Google Maps link
 * **`!date`** tells you the day the footage was recorded
 * **`!miles`** are a way to earn points for watching the stream... **`!leaderboard`** shows the users who have the most miles.
 * **`!guess`** gives viewers an opportunity to guess what state we're in, e.g. `!guess CA` guesses that we're in California

Future commands include `!map` (to display a map on the stream) and `!temperature` (to get information about the weather at the current moment).
