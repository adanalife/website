The following projects were used in some way during the making of this website.

 * Basic structure inspired by [html5-boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/)
 * Site written in Ruby and generated by [middleman](https://middlemanapp.com)
 * Tufte-inspired stylesheet by [tufte-css](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/)<%= sn 'Seriously, check out [Edward Tufte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte) and his work on information design' %>
 * CloudFormation templates provided by [@sjevs on GitHub](https://github.com/sjevs/cloudformation-s3-static-website-with-cloudfront-and-route-53)
 * Share icons were provided by [Simple Sharing Buttons](https://simplesharingbuttons.com/)

If you want to read more about the design of the site, I wrote about:
