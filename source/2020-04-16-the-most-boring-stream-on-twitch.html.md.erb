An endless road.

Exactly a year ago I [quietly launched a project](/2018/08/20/jump-into-my-passenger-seat/) on the Twitch.tv streaming platform.
I didn't expect much response.
It goes against everything Twitch stands for: it's prerecorded, repetitive, uneventful, and sometimes downright boring.
But despite all that, people have watched it for over 40,000 hours and I have a loyal community that recently passed a thousand followers.

I'd like to share with you my experience creating the channel, building a community, and the nature of attention in the modern world.


## Background

In 2018 I took a year off from my job to pursue a dream of mine: a year-long, cross-country road trip.
I won't go into too much detail on that here (there's lots of articles in the [archives](/tags/van/)), but during that time I felt constant pressure to share details of my adventures with my online audience.
People wanted to see how I was spending my time.

The trouble was, creating content took time away from my adventures, and I had no audience to speak of (other than my wonderful friends and family).
I tried growing a social media presence but I never felt comfortable promoting myself -- a key aspect of the social media game.

During some point in the hundreds of hours of driving I hatched a plan: I would save all of my dashcam footage and make it available online as an epic [slow tv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_television) project. 
The objective was to allow me to "passively" generate content while simply doing the driving I was already doing.
I didn't know if anyone would watch it, but I knew the idea was at the very least unique.

## 250 Hours of Footage

While premise was simple, it wasn't easy.
The SD card in [my dashcam](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M28B92C?tag=danalol-20) could only fit around 8 hours of `1080p60fps` footage, so every couple days I would have to pull out my laptop and back up the footage to an 8TB external hard drive.
If I waited too long the oldest footage would be overwritten.
<%= marginnote("Unfortunately this did happen on occasion, most notably I lost many hours of gorgeous footage of Badlans National Park.") %>
When I had reliable wifi, I backed up the footage to the cloud (using Amazon Glacier).

For storage-saving reasons, I didn't record any audio with the dashcam.
This decision ended up being controversial to some members of my community, but had I kept the audio you'd have to listen to muffled fragments of my podcasts and audiobooks.
Instead, I decided I would play music over the footage.

When the trip was over I had in hand about 2.5TB of unedited footage, enough storage to hold 1/8th the text in the Library of Congress!

Some of it was captivating.
Most of it was uneventful.
All of it was high-quality, consistent, and honest footage of the United States of America.


## Trimming

While some viewers have remarked that they wish I had left the footage unedited, the average user gets immediately bored and "changes the channel" when nothing changes after about 20 seconds or so.
As a result I tried to trim out all moments where the vehicle wasn't moving.
<%= marginnote("I did not trim any red lights, traffic, or other normal driving circumstances") %>

Needless to say, editing 250+ hours of footage isn't an easy task.

I made my first passes using the video [thumbnails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumbnail) as a guide.
One can make some decent inferences using thumbnails alone: for instance if two or more videos in a row have the exact same opening frame, all but the last video can be safely cut.

I also looked for thumbnails of gas stations, parking lots, drive-through restaurant lines, and other humdrum moments.
Instead of cutting them completely, I carefully trimmed them to appear as if I pulled into the parking space, came to a stop, and immediately pulled out.
There are countless cuts like this, and I think most go by without people noticing.



## Going Live

In April, on my birthday, I officially went live.
Viewers started to trickle in, mainly people browsing the [Travel & Outdoors](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Travel%20%26%20Outdoors) category on Twitch.

The response was generally positive, but it was obvious the channel wasn't for everyone.
Many new viewers watch the channel for about a minute, realize that it's pre-recorded, and leave forever.
Put simply, my channel doesn't provide the back-and-forth between streamer and viewer that those users come to expect.

Others, however, got hooked.

I have viewers who have watched hundreds of hours, enough to see the footage loop several times.
They compete with each other for a spot on the "miles leaderboard," and chat with each other about their days.
Some run the `!location` command frequently to check in on where we are, and others devote their second monitor to the channel.

Some stats on my audience:
 * 242 average unique daily viewers
 * 165 average daily hours watched
 * 55% of viewers are from outside the USA
 * $153.78 revenue from Twitch (from subscriptions and ads, mainly)

I surveyed my audience

 20% of my followers eventually unfollow me

With the most boring footage on the cutting room floor, I was ready to go live.
But I was missing something.
Pleasant footage and pleasant music might be enough to pass the bare minimum requirements to be a Twitch channel, but there was nothing to keep a viewer engaged, nothing to keep them coming back.
Furthermore, with a 24/7 stream there was no way I could be around to chat and answer peoples' questions.

So I built a robot.

But first, some background:
Twitch chat is an always-running chatroom associated with every channel on Twitch.
Viewers of a channel can interact with other viewers and the streamer, and streamers occasionally utilize off-the-shelf software called "chatbots" to simplify common tasks.
<!-- For instance a viewer might run `!uptime` to see how long a stream has been running, or  -->

None of the existing bots could do what I wanted my bot to do, so I built my own, from scratch.
I named him Tripbot.
Most new visitors to my channel come and go without even noticing there is a helpful bot in the channel, but I can say with certainty that more hours have been put into building the bot than any other feature of the channel.

<!-- My channel goes against nearly everything Twitch represents: it's prerecorded, it barely features me as the streamer, and it has nothing to do with video games.  -->


Thank you for reading!
I really appreciate you taking the time out of your day to visit my site.
