I'm really excited to announce a new project I've been working on:

<% iframe_wrapper do %>
  <iframe src="https://player.twitch.tv/?channel=adanalife_&muted=true" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>
<% end %>

You know those TV channels that are just 24/7 fishtanks or yule logs?
This is basically the same idea, but it's driving footage from my van adventure.

Sit back, relax, and let me chauffeur you around the USA!

## FAQ

### **Is this live?**

Nope, so far this is 100% pre-recorded footage.


### **When does it end?**

Essentially never!
I have literally hundreds of hours of video, so every time you visit you should see something different.


### **What kind of dashcam do you use?**

I am using a [VIOFO Compact A119](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M28B92C?tag=danalol-20) with a [polarizing filter](https://smile.amazon.com/Spytec-A11CPL-Circular-Polarizing-Reflections/dp/B01NAD4MZP?tag=danalol-20).


Thank you!
