I'm really excited to announce a new project I've been working on:

<% iframe_wrapper do %>
  <iframe src="https://player.twitch.tv/?channel=adanalife_" allow="autoplay" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" height="378" width="620"></iframe>
<% end %>

You know those TV channels that are just 24/7 fishtanks or yule logs?
This is basically the same idea, but it's driving footage from my van adventure.

Sit back, relax, and let me chauffeur you around the USA!


## FAQ

### **Is this live?**

Nope, so far this is 100% pre-recorded footage.


### **Is this the final version?**

No, consider this a beta release.
There is a lot more I intend on adding when I am no longer on the road.


### **Where is the audio?**

I'm not recording any audio with the dashcam because it's just engine noise and audiobooks.
Trust me, it's boring.

It is my plan to include chill music in the final version of this project.
It's a little complicated to explain why, but I won't be able to include music until I'm no longer living on the road.

In the meantime I encourage you to put [Groove Salad](http://somafm.com/player/#/now-playing/groovesalad) on in the background.


### **Is it in chronological order?**

Not currently.
I'm playing the days in random order for variety's sake.


### **When does it end?**

Essentially never!
I have literally hundreds of hours of video, so every time you visit you should see something different.


### **Are you still adding more video?**

Yep!
As long as I am still full-timing in the van, I will be recording footage and adding it to this project.


### **What kind of dashcam do you use?**

I am using a [VIOFO Compact A119](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M28B92C?tag=danalol-20) with a [polarizing filter](https://smile.amazon.com/Spytec-A11CPL-Circular-Polarizing-Reflections/dp/B01NAD4MZP?tag=danalol-20).


### **Can I do anything to help?**

It's so nice of you to ask that.
You could:

* Play this video on your TV or second monitor
* [Follow me on Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/adanalol_/follow) (registration required)
* Share this with a friend

Thank you!
