I walk home from work every day.
It's a little over 2.5 miles (4km) from Union Square to Haight-Ashbury, so it's not exactly the quickest option.
I do it because I know I am leaving San Francisco and I do not intend to come back.

I knew I was going to leave before I moved out here<%= mn 'I moved to SF from Boston in 2013' %>.
I've always wanted to _have lived_ in California, and I told my friends and family in New England that I expected to be out for 3-5 years.
