I walk home from work every day.
It's a little over 2.5 miles (4km) from Union Square to Haight-Ashbury, so it's not exactly the quickest option.
I do it because I know I am leaving San Francisco and I do not intend to live here again.

I knew I was going to leave before I moved out here<%= mn 'I moved to SF from Boston in 2013' %>.
I've always wanted to _have lived_ in California, and I told my friends and family in New England that I expected to be out for 3-5 years.
Many people gave me knowing chuckles and told me that once SF got its hooks in me, I'd probably end up reconsidering that.

They were right that SF is an amazing place.
It's beauty is something that needs to be seen firsthand.
I will never tire of seeing the Golden Gate Bridge poke out above distant buildings, or the majestic views you can see as you walk across it, like this one (taken on my first visit to SF in 2013):

The problem is, everyone knows SF (and the rest of the Bay Area) is incredible.
It's currently one of the most desirable places to live, and there's just not enough space for everyone.
It'd be nice to put down roots here, but to do so I'd have to double down on my career to even think about affording property.
