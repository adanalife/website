One of the best reasons to get into ham radio is for emergency preparedness. Living in San Francisco, there is always a chance there could be an earthquake, a tsunami, or another disaster. When the S hits the F, what are the odds your cell phone will work? Do you think you'll have access to the Internet?

The truth is, almost every form of communication we make in the modern world requires some form of infrastructure. Phone calls, text messages, instant messages, even snail mail requires an unfathomable amount of little things to go just right.

Ham radio, aka amateur radio, deftly sidesteps this issue by requiring only two functional radios and two people capable of using them. Depending on your location and your radio setup, you can hear or talk with people miles away.
