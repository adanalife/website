Hello friends, short update here.
I just wanted to share a cool experience I had while I was in LA.

A friend of mine works on the creative team on the acclaimed TV game show [The Price is Right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Price_Is_Right).
He invited me to visit him at the CBS studios in Hollywood, so obviously I took him up on it.
Here are some of the photos I took while I was there.
