It’s Friday, and I’m not at work. It’s my first day of unemployment, and one of my last days in San Francisco.
The van adventure begins in less than a week.

I know how exciting that sounds, but it’s been a very hard day.
I woke up earlier than I would for work and started a task I dread: packing.
The storage container where my possessions will live for the next few months arrives on Monday.
Due to my affection for objects and my tendency to fastidiously research my purchases, I own an overwhelming amount of stuff.
Soon I’ll be free from the burden of stuff-ownership and my next chapter will begin.

Until then, this doesn’t feel like vacation. I don’t feel like I have raised anchor, instead this feels like I cut the anchor line and I’m starting to drift. It’s the biggest change in my life so far, and so far it doesn’t feel fun!

I have to remind myself this is just the beginning; endless untold stories lie only a few sunsets away.
