Earlier this year, on my birthday, I quietly launched a project on the Twitch.tv streaming platform.
I didn't expect much response.
It's repetitive, uneventful, and oftentimes downright boring.
But despite all that, people have watched it for over 40,000 hours and I just recently passed a thousand followers.

I've never had a personal project acheive this level of success, so I'd like to share with you my experience.


## Background

In 2018 I took a year off from my job to pursue a dream of mine: a year-long, cross-country road trip.
I won't go into too much detail on that here (there's lots of articles in the [archives](/tags/van/)), but during that time I felt constant pressure to share details of my adventures with my online audience.
People wanted to see how I was spending my time.

The trouble was, creating content took time away from my adventures, and I had no audience to speak of (other than my wonderful friends and family).
I tried growing a social media presence but I never felt comfortable promoting myself -- a key aspect of the social media game.

During some point in the hundreds of hours of driving I hatched a plan: I would save all of my dashcam footage and make it available online as an epic [slow tv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_television) project. 
The goal was to allow me to "passively" generate content while simply doing the driving I was already doing.






My channel goes against nearly everything Twitch represents: it's prerecorded, it barely features me as the streamer, and it has nothing to do with video games.
