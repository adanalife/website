Earlier this year I quietly launched a project on the Twitch.tv streaming platform.
I didn't expect much response.
My stream is repetitive, uneventful, and oftentimes downright boring.
But despite all that, people have watched it for over 40,000 hours and I just recently passed a thousand followers.

I'd like to share with you my experience building the channel, growing the community, and the nature attention in the modern world.


## Background

In 2018 I took a year off from my job to pursue a dream of mine: a year-long, cross-country road trip.
I won't go into too much detail on that here (there's lots of articles in the [archives](/tags/van/)), but during that time I felt constant pressure to share details of my adventures with my online audience.
People wanted to see how I was spending my time.

The trouble was, creating content took time away from my adventures, and I had no audience to speak of (other than my wonderful friends and family).
I tried growing a social media presence but I never felt comfortable promoting myself -- a key aspect of the social media game.

During some point in the hundreds of hours of driving I hatched a plan: I would save all of my dashcam footage and make it available online as an epic [slow tv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_television) project. 
The objective was to allow me to "passively" generate content while simply doing the driving I was already doing.
I didn't know if anyone would watch it, but I knew the idea was at the very least unique.


## The Content

While the idea to save all of my dashcam footage was simple, it wasn't easy.
The SD card in [my dashcam](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M28B92C?tag=danalol-20) could only fit around 8 hours of 1080p60fps footage, so every couple days I would have to pull out my laptop and back up the footage to an 8TB external hard drive.
If I waited too long the oldest footage would be overwritten.
<%= marginnote("Unfortunately this did happen on occasion, most notably I lost many hours of gorgeous footage of Badlans National Park.") %>
When I had reliable wifi, I backed up the footage to the cloud (using Amazon Glacier).

When the trip was over and the van sold, I had in hand about 2.5TB of unedited footage, or about 1/8th the size of the text in the Library of Congress.

Some of it was captivating.
Most of it was uneventful.
All of it was high-quality, consistent, and honest footage of the United States of America.

My channel goes against nearly everything Twitch represents: it's prerecorded, it barely features me as the streamer, and it has nothing to do with video games.
