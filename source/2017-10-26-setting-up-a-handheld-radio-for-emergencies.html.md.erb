In [part 1](/2017/10/11/san-francisco-emergency-radio-setup) of this series, I wrote about why a San Francisco resident might want to keep a cheap two-way radio with their emergency supplies.
In this article I will walk through purchasing and setting up your own radio.

_**Important note!** Talking over a radio without an FCC license is against the law. You can, however, listen all you want, and you may talk over it in an emergency. I highly recommend you get licensed if this kind of stuff is interesting to you._

I suggest buying a [Baofeng UV-5R](https://smile.amazon.com/BaoFeng-UV-5R-Dual-Radio-Black/dp/B007H4VT7A?tag=danalol-20) (~$26) for your emergency kit.
They're very useful radios for their price, and they will allow you to dip your toe into the amateur radio world without spending a fortune.

If you've ever used a walkie talkie, you will find operating a radio is pretty straightforward.
The big difference is that with a ham radio, there's a ton more channels you can tune to.
Finding someone to talk to can be overwhelming...
it's similar to finding a good FM radio station when you're traveling out-of-state, but with the added challenge of most stations being silent almost all of the time.<%= sn 'You might want to buy a ["Nifty" UV-5R Reference Manual](https://smile.amazon.com/Baofeng-UV-5R-Tri-Folded-Reference-Accessories/dp/B018GM9OJG?tag=danalol-20), which is much easier to understand than the manual that comes with your radio.' %>

In any given geographic area, there are certain frequencies where people tend to hang out, or frequencies where emergency responders communicate.
The trick is to pre-program your radio with these frequencies so you do not struggle to find someone during an emergency.

The absolute easiest way to set up your radio is to use a USB cable to program your radio via your computer.
<%= sn "If this seems too complex, [reach out to me](/contact) and I can sell you a pre-programmed radio." %>
I'll walk you through the basic steps:

1. Purchase a <%= link_to 'BaoFeng Programming Cable', 'https://smile.amazon.com/Baofeng-Programming-Cable-BAOFENG-BF-888S/dp/B00CP0I474?tag=danalol-20' %> (~$5)
2. Download and install [`chirp`](http://chirp.danplanet.com)
3. Download the <%= link_to 'useful SF frequencies', "Baofeng_UV-5R_#{current_article.data.config_version}.csv" %> file I prepared for you
4. Connect your radio to your computer with the USB cable and launch `chirp`
5. Import the useful SF frequencies file into `chirp`
6. Upload the config to your radio
7. Disconnect your radio and power it on

If you manage to complete all of these steps, you should be greeted with a welcome message and you will be able to start flipping through the pre-programmed channels.
You will probably even find people talking, but remember, _you can't talk over the radio until you get your license from the FCC!_

In the next article, I will talk about the frequencies I included in my saved config file, and explain a little about why I picked them.
