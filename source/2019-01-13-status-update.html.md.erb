Eleven months ago today, I reversed my campervan out of my driveway in San Francisco and set forth on a magnificent adventure.
I had ended my lease, put my possessions in storage, and packed the van with things I might need.
I traveled alone across the country, [from San Diego to Maine and back](/2018/09/26/map-adventure-so-far-v2/).
I experienced so many great things, and I have so much to share with you!

<%= mn("This photo, for instance, was taken at sunrise while in Acadia National Park") %>
<%= f "#{current_article.url}cruise-ship-sunrise.jpg", 'a cruise ship in front of a sunrise from Mount Desert Island, Maine' %>

For those who have been following this blog since I started, you know that my articles are few and far between.
<%# Each article takes me hours of editing (even more if I have lots of photos), and vanlife isn't usually conducive to sitting in front of a computer long stretches. %>
Early on in the trip I decided to spend more time adventuring and less writing articles.
I have been slowly, sneakily backfilling blog posts so that it appears I wrote them in realtime.
Allow me to reassure you: _the plan is to eventually have an article about every awesome place I went._

In addition to the "trip reports," I have a <%= link_to('Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)', '/faq') %> section in the works (update: published!).
Here you will be able to find answers to common questions like "did you ever feel unsafe?" and "did you get lonely?"
_If you have anything you'd like to see answered, go ahead and use the "ask me anything" link above!_
<%= mn(linked_image("#{current_article.url}waterlilies.jpg", 'some waterlilies in Acadia National Park')) %>

I also have a number of other articles in the works that are more about vanlife in general...
tips on saving money, apps I used all the time, suggestions for things to keep in the van, and some other things in that vein.
These I suspect will be some of the most popular articles because they appeal to the wide audience of vanlifers and aspiring vanlifers.

Finally, I have over 250 hours_(!)_ of dashcam footage saved for the [upcoming "slow TV" project](/2018/08/20/jump-into-my-passenger-seat/).
That project is on hold right now (I need to settle back into a normal life in order to add music and other features), but I'm really excited about it.
_You'll be able to tune in and watch my journey around the country, be it boring or spectacularly beautiful._

<br>

<%= nt "In summary," %> my adventure is winding down, but there's still much to be done for this project.
You can expect more trip reports, an extensive <%= link_to('FAQ', '/faq') %>, new articles with vanlife tips, and a 24-hour-a-day stream of driving.

Oh, one more thing!
