Would you like to help out the [most boring stream on Twitch](/2020/04/16/the-most-boring-stream-on-twitch/)?
Do you have Amazon Prime?
Do you have a Twitch account, or the willingness to create one?
_That's all you need!_

[Connect your Amazon account to your Twitch account](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/twitch-prime-guide#HowtoSubscribetoTwitchPrime), and you can subscribe **for free** [using Twitch Prime](https://subs.twitch.tv/adanalife_).
You get some bonuses (including `!bonusmiles` and no ads), plus the channel gets a couple bucks.
It's win-win, and you can do it again next month.
