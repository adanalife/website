Would like like to help the [stream](TODO)?
You don't have to spend any money.
Do you have Amazon Prime?
_That's all you need!_

Simply [connect your Amazon account](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/twitch-prime-guide#HowtoSubscribetoTwitchPrime) to your Twitch account, then [subscribe for free using Twitch Prime](https://subs.twitch.tv/adanalife_).
You get some bonuses (including extra miles!), and the channel gets a couple bucks.
It's win-win, and you can do it again next month.

Thanks for your support!
