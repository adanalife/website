Want to help the [stream](TODO)?
Don't want to spend any money?
Do you have Amazon Prime?
**Great!**

All you have to do is [connect your Amazon account](https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/twitch-prime-guide#HowtoSubscribetoTwitchPrime) to your Twitch account, and then [subscribe for free using Twitch Prime](https://subs.twitch.tv/adanalife_).
You get some bonuses (including extra miles!), and the channel gets a couple bucks.
It's win-win, and you can subscribe once a month.

Here's a video that sums it up nicely:
